<!-- Content Sections -->
<div class="content-sections">
  <h4 id="central-tendency">Measures of Central Tendency</h4>
  <p>
    This section covers the basics of mean, median, and mode, how to calculate them, and their significance in summarizing data. Learn how to implement these measures in R and interpret the results effectively.
  </p>

  <h4 id="variability">Measures of Variability</h4>
  <p>
    Explore different measures of variability such as range, variance, and standard deviation. Understand how these measures provide insights into the spread and dispersion of data points around a central value, and learn to calculate them in R.
  </p>

  <h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
  <p>
    Learn the fundamental principles of probability, including conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and the law of large numbers. This section provides R code examples to demonstrate how to compute probabilities and apply them to real-world scenarios.
  </p>

  <h4 id="distributions">Distributions</h4>
  <p>
    Understand different types of statistical distributions (e.g., normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions) and their applications. Use R to visualize these distributions and understand their properties.
  </p>

  <h4 id="correlations">Correlations</h4>
  <p>
    This section focuses on understanding the relationships between variables through correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman). Learn how to calculate and interpret correlations in R and visualize them using scatter plots.
  </p>

  <h4 id="regressions">Regressions</h4>
  <p>
    Learn about linear and multiple regression techniques, how they are used to model relationships between variables, and predict outcomes. Use R to perform regression analysis and understand diagnostics for model evaluation.
  </p>

  <h4 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis Testing</h4>
  <p>
    Discover the logic behind hypothesis testing, including setting up null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, and confidence intervals. Perform hypothesis tests in R and interpret the results.
  </p>

  <h4 id="t-tests">T-Tests</h4>
  <p>
    This section covers one-sample, two-sample, and paired t-tests, explaining their use in comparing means between groups. Implement t-tests in R and interpret the output for decision-making.
  </p>

  <h4 id="anova">Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</h4>
  <p>
    Learn about ANOVA techniques (one-way, two-way, and repeated measures) used to analyze differences between group means. Use R to perform ANOVA tests and understand the assumptions and outputs.
  </p>

  <h4 id="chi-square">Chi-Square Tests</h4>
  <p>
    Understand the Chi-square test for independence and goodness-of-fit, used for categorical data analysis. Apply these tests in R and learn how to interpret the results.
