**Welcome!**
=====
I'm Adri√°n, a brain science enthusiast & Research Data Manager in the Applied Neuroimaging Statistics Research Laboratory at McLean Hospital. My educational journey has led me through a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Health & Social Behavior at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, a Master of Education (EdM) in Human Development from Harvard Graduate School of Education, and a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Cognitive/Behavioral Neuroscience & Psychology from Loyola University Chicago.

My philosophy on ADEIB is deeply influenced by my intersectional experiences as a Latinx, Queer, Non-Binary, Disabled, First-Generation, and Low-Income individual. These identities, coupled with my professional and educational experiences, shape my understanding of power, privilege, and oppression.

In academic and community spaces, I strive to apply these principles through mindful mentorship and collaboration. Recognizing the complexity of growth in ADEIB, I commit to learning from both successes and failures. I aspire to maintain an open mind and humility, acknowledging that progress in fostering inclusive environments is ongoing, non-linear, and unique to each context.

I actively seek opportunities to improve, listen, and adapt, ensuring that my actions contribute positively to building spaces where everyone feels seen, heard, and empowered by default.
