title: "Computational Conduits: Pioneering Precision Psychiatry through Advanced Modeling"
excerpt: "My research seeks to pioneer the use of normative and computational modeling to revolutionize the field of precision psychiatry. By integrating advanced neuroimaging techniques with behavioral and epigenetic data, I aim to develop refined models that predict individual mental health outcomes with unprecedented accuracy. This approach will not only improve our understanding of psychiatric disorders but also tailor interventions to the unique biological profile of each patient. Through this innovative research, I plan to contribute to the creation of more personalized and effective psychiatric treatments, thereby transforming how mental health care is approached and administered. <br/><img src='/images/CC Model.svg'>"
