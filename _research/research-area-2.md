title: "Cultivating Resilience: Multilevel Approaches for Flourishing in Oppressed Communities"
excerpt: "I intend to focus on contextualized interventions that foster resilience, thriving, and flourishing among oppressed communities, utilizing strategies that engage at the structural, community, and individual levels. My research will examine the effectiveness of these comprehensive interventions, particularly how they meet the unique challenges faced by these communities to promote sustainable growth and well-being. I am especially interested in exploring the potential of psychoeducation, psychotherapy, & psychedelic therapeutics as transformative tools for personal development and mental health at the individual level. Through my doctoral studies, I aspire to contribute significantly to the development and refinement of interventions that not only address but also transcend the adversities faced by oppressed populations.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
