title: "Ecosystems of Emotion: Tracing Social and Ecological Influences on Development"
excerpt: "I plan to explore the dynamic interactions between ecological systems and social determinants of health, focusing on how they influence emotional processing mechanisms from perinatal stages through young adulthood. My research will delve into understanding the complex effects of environmental and social factors on emotional health, aiming to identify intervention strategies that effectively mitigate adverse effects and enhance developmental trajectories. This area of study seeks to provide deep insights into how varied ecological and social contexts contribute to emotional wellbeing, paving the way for innovative, targeted approaches that support sustained emotional growth and resilience. <br/><img src='/images/EE Model.svg'>"
