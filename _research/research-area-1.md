title: "Echoes of Trauma & Adversity: Unraveling Lifespan Impacts in Neurodevelopment and Epigenetics"
excerpt: "I plan to explore the clinical, epigenetic, and neurodevelopmental impacts of adverse and traumatic experiences, focusing on how dimensions of threat, deprivation, and unpredictability influence individuals from perinatal stages through young adulthood. My goal is to investigate the intricate relationships between traumatic/adverse experiences and long-term health outcomes, aiming to unravel the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors that shape mental and physical health. As I prepare to enter a PhD program, my research will seek to illuminate these crucial intersections, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of how early life stressors impact lifelong health and well-being. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
