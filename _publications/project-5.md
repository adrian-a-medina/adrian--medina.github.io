excerpt: "Prior investigations of emotion processing’s neural underpinnings rely on task contrast-based analyses. This has constrained identification of relevant neuronal processes and obscured their temporal dynamics. Here, we apply unsupervised learning to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during the emotional face matching task (EFMT) in healthy young adult participants from the Human Connectome Project (n=413; n=416 for replication; non-overlapping family structure). We find that the EFMT engages 10 large-scale networks – each recruiting visual association cortex in distinct temporal fashions and in tandem with distinct non-visual circuits – collectively recruiting 74% of cortex, cerebellum and amygdala. Despite prominent use of the EFMT to probe negative affect, EFMT-recruited networks did not include subgenual cingulate or reflect individual differences in internalizing/negative affect. Contrarily, networks strongly reflected individual differences in cognition. Overall, we characterize a richer-than-expected tapestry of EFMT-recruited neuronal processes, their diverse activation dynamics, and their distinct relations to task performance and mental health."
