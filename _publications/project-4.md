excerpt: "Children born to women who experienced childhood maltreatment have higher diagnostic risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Chronic systemic inflammation has been associated with childhood maltreatment and has been identified as a gestational risk factor for atypical neurodevelopment in offspring. Thus, inflammation may be a mechanism by which maternal exposure to maltreatment affects offspring neurodevelopment. We examine associations between maternal childhood maltreatment and four selected inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor 2 (TNF-R2), and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), among women prior to or during pregnancy. Maltreatment was assessed using the validated 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Our sample included a total of 329 women, 204 who were intending to become pregnant and 124 who were pregnant, drawn from the Nurses’ Health Study 3, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study. Fifty participants were exposed to no abuse (28 of those intending to become pregnant  and 22 of those pregnant) and 81 participants were exposed to moderate or severe abuse (55 of those intending to become pregnant and 26 of those pregnant). No association was identified between childhood maltreatment and the four inflammatory biomarkers, either among participants intending to become pregnant or among pregnant participants in this sample of well-educated, primarily non-Hispanic white women. Further investigation of these associations in more vulnerable populations might enhance our understanding of biological mechanisms linking maternal childhood abuse to ASD and ADHD in offspring."
