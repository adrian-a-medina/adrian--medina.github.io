excerpt: "Recent research underscores the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health challenges in pediatric populations. This study specifically addresses the vulnerability of children with neurodevelopmental disorders—including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD), and other cognitive disabilities—to the impacts of ACEs. It investigates the influence of adverse childhood experiences on mental health outcomes within this demographic and assesses how well-defined aspects of child flourishing—curiosity in learning, emotional control, and task persistence—can mitigate these effects. Drawing from the National Survey of Children’s Health, our analysis encompassed a subset of children with reported neurodevelopmental issues (N = 44,776, M<sub>Age</sub> = 12.2), focusing on their ACEs and child flourishing metrics. Logistic regression models were utilized, incorporating interaction terms between ACEs and flourishing measures to explore the protective role of flourishing behaviors. We identified a significant dose-response relationship between the number of ACEs and heightened risks of anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues in neurodivergent children. Notably, the presence of child flourishing significantly moderated these risks, suggesting a robust protective mechanism against the adverse impacts of ACEs. These results affirm the critical protective capacity of flourishing in mitigating the negative effects of ACEs on neurodivergent children's mental health. Our findings support the integration of flourishing-based strategies in interventions and policies aimed at fostering resilience and improving mental health outcomes in this vulnerable population. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to further explore the dynamic interplay between ACEs, flourishing, and neurodiversity."
