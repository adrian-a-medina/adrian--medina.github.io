excerpt: "Brain asymmetries are hypothesized to reduce funcIonal duplicaIon and thus have evoluIonary advantages. The goal of this study was to examine whether early brain lateralizaIon contributes to skill development within the speech-language domain. To achieve this goal, 25 infants (2-13 months old) underwent behavioral language examinaIon as well as fMRI during sleep while listening to forward and backward speech and then were assessed on various language skills at 55-69 months old. We observed that infant funcIonal lateralizaIon of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) for forward > backward speech was associated with phonological, vocabulary, and expressive language skills 4 to 5 years later. However, we failed to observe that infant language skills or the anatomical lateralizaIon of STG were related to subsequent language skills. Overall, our findings suggest that infant funcIonal lateralizaIon of STG for speech percepIon may scaffold subsequent language acquisiIon, supporIng the hypothesis that funcIonal hemisphere asymmetries are advantageous.
