excerpt: "The prevalence of mental health issues among young people globally highlights the need for effective interventions like positive psychology interventions (PPIs), which enhance well-being and prevent mental disorders. Our study synthesizes data from randomized controlled trials and controlled trials involving digital PPIs across clinical and nonclinical populations of children, adolescents, and young adults. A systematic review of 35 studies showed that PPIs significantly improved indicators of well-being such as purpose, gratitude, hope, and reduced negative outcomes like stress and cognitive biases. Meta-analysis revealed larger effects in studies with waiting list controls compared to digital controls, and a funnel plot indicated no publication bias. This evidence supports the effectiveness of digital PPIs in enhancing mental health among the young, suggesting a need for further research to optimize these interventions."
